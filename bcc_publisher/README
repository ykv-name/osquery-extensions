1. Switch to the `alessandro/provision/full-boost-for-extensions` branch (https://github.com/trailofbits/osquery-pr/tree/alessandro/provision/full-boost-for-extensions)
2. Run `make sysprep` (this should also run `make deps` automatically)
3. flex, bison and m4 should now be installed, but they will not quite work yet:
```
mkdir -p /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew
ln -s /usr/local/osquery/opt /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt
ln -s /usr/local/osquery/Cellar /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/Cellar
```
4. Download the LLVM and Clang source tarballs and extract them in osquery-extensions/bcc_publisher/utils/llvm-bpf; then build and install that folder. It may require some changes to the LLVM CMake files to skip checks on the atomic libraries
5. Build and install the extensions as always
